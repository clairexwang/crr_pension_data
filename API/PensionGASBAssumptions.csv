4,2001,0,0,,,Projected Unit Credit,In the development of valuation assets we use an expected investment return equal to the investment return assumption of 8.25%. The valuation assets are then compared to a 5% corridor around the market value of assets. Any amount below the corridor is a current deferred gain and any amount above the corridor is a current deferred loss. The outstanding balance of previously deferred amounts is determined. If both the outstanding balance and any current amount are deferred gains or losses the greater of the two is amortized. If one of either the outstanding balance or the current amount is a deferred gain and the other is deferred loss the difference is amortized. The amount amortized is applied to the employer contribution rate as a level percentage of the present value of pay over 20 years under the 1% population projection scenario. Valuation assets cannot be outside the range of 80% to 120% of the market value of assets. All assets are valued at market value. Assets are accounted for on an accrued basis and are taken directly from audited financial statements provided by KPMG LLP.ounts are within a 5% corridor of the market value of assets,Level Percent Fixed,.0325,.0825,2,,,1,2,25,,30jun2001
